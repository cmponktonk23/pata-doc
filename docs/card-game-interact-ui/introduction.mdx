# Card Game Interact UI Tutorials

## Package content

Create a new unity project and download the package in unity asset store, then import the package 
to project by choosing “Assets”, “Import Package”, “Custom Package” and select the package 
downloaded. The package structure should be the same as Fig.1:

* The `Assets` folder contains five subfolders: Animations, Materials, Prefabs, Scripts and Textures.
The files in these folders included in the demo.
* The `Document` folder contains a tutorial document.

##  Demo scene

Run the demo scene as Fig.2, the cards in hand will show on the bottom center of unity “Game” 
window. The draw pile and discard pile locate on the bottom-left and bottom-right corner of the 
window. For testing the arrow interaction, we put two characters (enemy and attendant) in the 
demo. The buttons and texts locate on the top of the window. 

### Resolution

The UI effects can work in Free Aspect, but we recommend run the demo under `16:9` for the best 
performance.

###  Play card

Click the card in hand then an arrow will extend from the card to mouse. When the arrow touches 
the different characters, its color will change to express hostility or friendly. At this time, click the 
character will play the card, then the attack effect or health buff effect will display on the enemy 
or attendant. After that, the card will be thrown into the discard pile.

### Draw/discard

Click the “Draw” button will add a card in hand from the draw pile.Click the “Discard” button 
will discard all cards in hand to the discard pile. 

Besides the two buttons, the red point with text on top of the draw pile and discard pile used to show the card number in them. 
When there are no cards left in hand and the draw pile, all the cards will be sent from the discard pile to the draw 
pile. After that, five cards will be sent to hand automatically.` The demo only supports at most 10 
cards in hand, please don’t modify the upper limit in the script, which will result in bad 
performance.`

## Scripts

The Scripts folder consists of Arrow, Card, Common, Monster, Particle Effects, UI:
* Files in `Card folder and Arrow folder` are the components of the gameobject “HandCards” in 
the hierarchy tab. It’s the most import part of this package. All the card effects, interactive arrow 
and game logic are controlled by this component. The introductions of parameters in this component 
are commented well with the ToolTip in unity editor, Fig.3.
* A light weight `EventManager` is implemented in `Common` folder for decouple the UI and game 
logic.
* `CameraController` is the camera’s script component, which is used to adapt resolutions of
different aspects.` This script is only designed for the demo, we don’t focus on working with the 
multi-screen adaptation, so there are still lots of work to do.`
* `EffectController` is the component of “AttackEffect” and “HealthBuffEffect” prefab under 
Prefabs folder. 
* `ToastController` is the component of “Toast” under the gameobject “UICanvas” in the hierarchy
tab. Its attribute “duration” controls the duration time of the toast.
