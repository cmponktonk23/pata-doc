# Vivid Paper Tutorials 

## Package content

Create a new unity project and download the package in unity asset store, then import the package 
to project by choosing ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù, ‚ÄúImport Package‚Äù, ‚ÄúCustom Package‚Äù and select the package 
downloaded. The package structure should be the same as Fig.1: 
* The `Assets` folder contains six subfolders: Materials, Models, Prefabs, Scripts, Shaders, Textures.
* The `Demo` folder contains a demo scene detail on: [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2C-aJOc-ac)  
* The `Document` folder contains a tutorial document.

## Demo Scene

Play the demo scene, there has a paper in center of the window under the game tab. You can also 
create a paper game object by the paper prefab supplied in Prefabs folder. Click the four corners of 
the paper and drag the mouse, the paper will deform with the mouse dragging position. When the 
mouse button up, the paper deformation will be reset smoothly. There is a sphere game object called 
‚ÄúPin‚Äù put on center of the paper, when you drag the paper, the paper deformation will be stopped by 
the sphere. You can copy some pins and put them on the paper, the paper‚Äôs deformation will be 
determined by the combination of pins dynamically. `Notice that the pin game object must be child 
object of the paper!` You can use this demo to achieve page turning effect in e-book or a 
poster/sticky note pin on the wall.

## Algorithm

This part is helpful for developers to implement a paper curling effect in different game scene. For 
example, implement a page turning UI effect to show players some introductions in your game. 
This algorithm is about wrapping a paper around a cylinder and calculate the vertexes' positions on 
the paper. First, let's imagine dragging the mouse from a paper's right up corner, and a cylinder 
whose central axis always pass through the mouse position and perpendicular to the mouse drag 
direction dynamically, just like Fig.3.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', }}>

</div>

### Cylinder central axis

The mouse drag direction will be determined by the current mouse position and a corner of the paper, 
that means as you click and drag the mouse on the paper, the start point of the vector will always be 
one of the four corners of the paper and the end point is current position of the mouse. You may ask 
why not calculated the vector by the mouse's position in last frame as the start point and the mouse's 
position in this frame as the end point. Try it and look the paper's behavior üòâ

Assume we drag the paper at right up corner on 3D coordinate system, the paper is on the xzcoordinate plane and its corner position is `(x0, y0, z0)`. 
Currently the mouse's position is `(x1, y1, z1). `
The straight line equation can be derived as `z=(z1-z0)/(x1-x0)*x+z1+(z0-z1)/(x1-x0)*x1`. Then 
the central axis of the cylinder which is perpendicular to the mouse dragging direction can be derived 
as `z=(x1-x0)/(z0-z1)*x+z1+(x0-x1)/(z0-z1)*x1`.

### Paper deformation

The right up part of the paper will be wrapped on the cylinder as Fig.4. Let's choose a vertex on the 
paper, its position is `(xv, yv, zv)`, the distance of the vertex to the cylinder's central axis on xzcoordinate plane is:
`dist=abs(A*xv+B*zv+C)/sqrt(A*A+B*B), A=(x1-x0)/(y0-y1), B=-1, C=z1+(x0-x1)/(z0-z1)*x1`
In Fig.4, we can get `Œ∏=dist/R (R is cylinder's radius).` The y position of the vertex on the paper after 
wrapping on the cylinder is `yv=R-R*cosŒ∏.`

The move direction on xz-coordinate plane of this vertex is `dir=(x1, z1)-(x0, z0).` The xz position 
of the vertex on the paper after wrapping on the cylinder is `(xv, zv)+normalized(dir)*(dist-R*sinŒ∏)`.
When the paper wrapped on the cylinder exceed 180 degree, we flatten the exceed part and the 
position of vertexes on this part can be derived as `(xv, zv)+normalized(dir)*(dist+dist-pi*R)` and `yv=2*R`, if you cannot figure out the equation, just try to draw the image as Fig.4 and 
wrap the paper on the cylinder.

Another thing we need to do is determine which part of the paper should be wrapped on the cylinder.
we can use cross product to check if the vertex on the paper is in clockwise direction of the vector 
which is acquired by rotating the mouse dragging direction 90 degree in clockwise direction. The 
start point of the vector is `(x1, z1)`, the end point of the vector is `(x2, z2)`, the check point is `(x3, z3)`. 
The cross product can be expressed as `(x1-x3)*(z2-z3)-(x2-x3)*(z1-z3)`, if the expression is
negative, the check point is in clockwise direction.

When the mouse button up, the paper needs to be flattened smoothly. This can be implemented by 
scrolling the cylinder back along the mouse drag direction to the paper's corner.

###  Paper deformation with considering Pins on it

Let's imagine turning a paper which has a pin on it. The paper curling as you dragging it from right 
to left until it touches a pin. Unless you tear the paper, it cannot move along current drag direction 
anymore. We can only drag the paper around the pin, but not turn it exceed the pin. This effect is 
really easy to implement üòÄ.

Assume we put lots of pins on a paper, then we drag the paper from right up corner to left as some 
direction. How could we determine which pin is first touched by the cylinder's central axis? We 
have derived the direction which is acquired by rotating the mouse drag direction 90 degree in 
clockwise direction, as `newDir=(z1-z0, x0-x1)`. We only need to set the start point of the vector as 
a pin's position, and check if there is a pin in clockwise direction of it (just like what we did in above 
to check which part of the paper should be wrapped on the cylinder). We find a pin which has no 
pins in clockwise direction of it, and it must be the first pin the cylinder's central axis touches.
Now, we have the pin's position and just replace the mouse position in above calculation as the pin's 
position. The steps are:
1. Drag the mouse and acquire the cylinder's central axis; 
2. Find the pin which will be first touched by the cylinder's central axis;
3. Scroll back the cylinder from mouse's position to pin's position with keeping its direction 
unchanged.

That is the main part of the paper curling effect. And I believe if you figure out the algorithm 
mentioned above, you can customize a wonderful paper turning effect in your game!
