## URP and HDRP

### Import Package

After import the package, the ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù, ‚ÄúDemo‚Äù folders under
`‚ÄúAssets/RoomBuildingStarterKit/‚Äù`
includes the assets and scenes work in Built-in Standard Render Pipeline. 
<p style={{color:'red'}}>Before import the URP or HDRP package, you need to delete these two folders first.</p>
For convenient to use the URP or HDRP project, we export the entire URP/HDRP 
project into two packages:

`‚ÄúAssets/RoomBuildingStarterKit/Install URP Assets.unitypackage‚Äù`
`‚ÄúAssets/RoomBuildingStarterKit/Install HDRP Assets.unitypackage‚Äù`

Import one of them, the ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù and ‚ÄúDemo‚Äù folder prepared for URP/HDRP project 
will be imported. Run the scenes under the Demo folder, that‚Äôs all you need to do!
During import HDRP assets, there will be a popup window named ‚ÄúRender Pipeline 
Wizard‚Äù as right picture. Don‚Äôt worry about the errors displayed on the wizard window. 
The HDRP project has no errors before export to package, after import the package the 
errors gone, no actions need you to do. The HDRP configurations are all under:
`‚ÄúAssets/RoomBuildingStarterKit/Assets/HDRPDefaultResources‚Äù`

You can select ‚ÄúDefaultSceneRoot‚Äù as the Default Scene Prefab.

`URP ScriptableRendererFeatureand HDRP CustomPassare used in this project! When 
the pipelines‚Äô version upgrade, the API maybe modified.`

`For URP versions, we tested the project from version 7.x to 10.x. It can work without any 
changes.`

`For HDRP versions, we tested the project from version 7.x to 10.x. Only v10.x need to 
update APIs. After upgrade the pipeline to v10.x, install the relative patch package under:`
`‚ÄúAssets/RoomBuildingStarterKit/Patches/HDRP_v10.x_patch.unitypackage‚Äù `

If you encounter any problem when upgrade to newest version. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to

        ## Build Rooms

        When you enter the game scene, there are four offices can be used to 
        build room. The center one has already unlocked. Other three offices 
        are occupied by some buildings. You could buy the building to 
        unlock the office. (Currently, shopping system has not been 
        implemented, so you can unlock them without any limitation.)

        You can build rooms in the unlocked offices. There are two buttons 
        on the tool bar. One is for settings, the other is for building room. In 
        the room list, you could choose one to build.

## Room reachable validation

All the rooms build in an office should be reached from every office 
doors. Such as if you have NPCs in your game. The NPCs will enter 
the office from the office doors. Then they can walk in the office and 
they need pass through room‚Äôs doors when they want to enter a room. 
In this project, you can build doors between rooms which means 
NPCs could directly enter a room from another room. You can also 
build rooms around by another room depends on the requirement in 
your game.

One room could build more than one door.` We supply an option for 
you to choose single door or multiple doors for a room.` You can 
change it at: 
`‚ÄúAssets/RoomBuildingStarterKit/Assets/Prefabs/RealRoom/Rooms‚Äù`

We also give an option to determine two doors‚Äô entrances can 
overlap or not. This function is used to avoid doors collide if NPC 
need to push to open the door. When check the ‚ÄúCan Door Entrance 
Overlap‚Äù, no two doors‚Äô entrances can overlap with each other
